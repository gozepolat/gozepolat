### Hey! I'm [@gozepolat](https://gozepolat.github.io/about) (Aydin Goze Polat, PhD) 👋

I am a researcher, engineer, and entrepreneur focusing on deep learning. 👨‍🔬 🤖

I live in Toronto, Canada. 🇨🇦

I previously built deep learning solutions in Turkey, Germany, and Canada while collaborating with different teams and organizations across the globe. 🌎

After introducing a new [graph based analysis for DL architectures](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/acc713), I created [**priors**](https://github.com/gozepolat/priors/tree/main/reusability) for comparing and ranking DL models in terms of estimated performance, i.e. __before any training is done__. 🚀

Currently I spend most of my time on bootstrapping full stack solutions as a **technical founder**. More details to come 🔜!
